# BLE Weather Station - Weather Server Side

This repository is part of my BLE Weather Station Project. The goal of this project is to learn BLE on the ESP32 architecture and to become familiar with the ESP-IDF framework based on FreeRTOS. The weather server will read data from a BME280 sensor and periodically send the readings through a BLE server using the NimBLE stack.
