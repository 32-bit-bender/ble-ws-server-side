# BLE Weather Station - Weather Server Side

This repository is one of two belonging my BLE Weather Station Project. The goal of this project is tolearn BLE on the ESP32 architecture aswell as get accustomed to the ESP-IDF framework based on FreeRTOS

The weather server side will be reading weather values off of a BME280 and sending the readings periodically through a BLE server based on the NimBLE stack.
